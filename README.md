I made this bundle to have the possibility to manage abbreviations in my projects.

This bundle contains
- Several filters for Abbreviations Content Type
- Link Provider
- Sitemap Provider
- Handler for Trash Items
- Handler for Automation
- Possibility to assign a contact as author
- Twig Extension for resolving Abbreviations / get a list of Abbreviations
- Events for displaying Activities
and more...

The abbreviations are translatable.

This bundle is still in development. Use at own risk ü§ûüèª


## üë©üèª‚Äçüè≠ Installation
Install the package with:
```console
composer require manuxi/sulu-abbreviations-bundle
```
If you're *not* using Symfony Flex, you'll also
need to add the bundle in your `config/bundles.php` file:

```php
return [
    //...
    Manuxi\SuluAbbreviationsBundle\SuluAbbreviationsBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```
Please add the following to your `routes_admin.yaml`:
```yaml
SuluAbbreviationsBundle:
    resource: '@SuluAbbreviationsBundle/Resources/config/routes_admin.yml'
```
Don't forget fo add the index to your sulu_search.yaml:

add "abbreviations"!

"abbreviations" is the index of published, "abbreviations_draft" the index of unpublished elements.
```yaml
sulu_search:
    website:
        indexes:
            - abbreviations
            - ...
``` 
Last but not least the schema of the database needs to be updated.  

Some tables will be created (prefixed with app_):  
abbreviations, abbreviations_translation.  

See the needed queries with
```
php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --dump-sql
```  
Update the schema by executing 
```
php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```  

Make sure you only process the bundles schema updates!

## üé£ Usage
First: Grant permissions for abbreviations. 
After reload you should see the abbreviations item in the navigation. 
Start to create abbreviations.
Use smart_content property type to show a list of abbreviations, e.g.:
```xml
<property name="abbreviations" type="smart_content">
    <meta>
        <title lang="en">Abbreviations</title>
        <title lang="de">Abbreviations</title>
    </meta>
    <params>
        <param name="provider" value="abbreviations"/>
        <param name="max_per_page" value="5"/>
        <param name="page_parameter" value="page"/>
    </params>
</property>
```
Example of the corresponding twig template for the abbreviations list:
```html
{% for abbreviation in abbreviations %}
    <div class="col">
        <h2>
            {{ abbreviation.name }}
        </h2>
        <p>
            {{ abbreviation.explanation|raw }}
        </p>
    </div>
{% endfor %}
```
